# 🚀 GitHub Actions Testing Guide

## ✅ **Compliance Fixes Applied - Ready for Testing**

Your GitHub Actions should now work properly! Here's how to test them:

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Basic Environment Validation Test**
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/gammadev-y/agora_kritis
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. Click **"🧠 Kritis V4.0 - PROD10 Final AI Legal Document Analysis"**
4. Click **"Run workflow"** button
5. Configure inputs:
   - **Source ID**: `validate-test` (dummy ID for testing)
   - **Pipeline Stage**: `validate-environment`
6. Click **"Run workflow"**

This will test that all modules load correctly without trying to process real data.

### **Step 2: Full Pipeline Test (if you have a real source ID)**
1. Same steps as above, but use:
   - **Source ID**: A real UUID from your database
   - **Pipeline Stage**: `v40-complete`

### **Step 3: Individual Stage Tests**
Test each stage separately:
- `v40-extract` - Test extraction only
- `v40-analyze` - Test analysis only  
- `v40-synthesize` - Test synthesis only
- `v40-ingest` - Test ingestion only

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **Success Indicators**
- ✅ Workflow starts without import errors
- ✅ "Set up Python 3.13" step completes
- ✅ "Install Dependencies" step installs all packages
- ✅ "Configure Environment" step sets up variables
- ✅ "Validate Source ID" step passes (for valid UUIDs)
- ✅ "Run Kritis V4.0 Analysis Pipeline" step executes

### **Previous Error (Now Fixed)**
- ❌ "No module named 'lib'" - This should NOT appear anymore

## 📊 **Expected Output**

### **Environment Validation Success**
```
🔧 Validating production environment...
✅ Environment variables configured
✅ KritisAnalyzerV4 import successful
✅ Supabase import successful
✅ Google GenerativeAI import successful
✅ UUID validation working correctly
✅ KritisAnalyzerV4 initialized successfully
✅ Database connection successful
📊 Validation Summary: 5/5 tests passed
🎉 All validation tests PASSED! Production ready!
```

### **Full Pipeline Success**
```
🚀 Starting Kritis V4.0 PROD10 Analysis for Source: [UUID]
📋 Pipeline Stage: v40-complete
🔄 Running Complete Kritis V4.0 PROD10 Pipeline
   - Stage 1: Enhanced Extraction with preamble awareness
   - Stage 2: Definitive Analysis with V4.2 prompts  
   - Stage 3: Final Summary Synthesis with category suggestions
   - Stage 4: Definitive Law Ingestion with date intelligence
✅ Complete V4.0 PROD10 pipeline finished successfully!
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If You Still Get Import Errors**
1. Check that secrets are properly set in repository settings
2. Verify the workflow file syntax
3. Check the Actions logs for specific error messages

### **Environment Secrets Required**
Make sure these are set in Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Successful Test**

1. **Monitor Workflow Runs**: Check that all stages complete successfully
2. **Validate Database Results**: Verify that laws and articles are created correctly
3. **Test Error Handling**: Try with invalid UUIDs to test error cases
4. **Scale Testing**: Run multiple documents to test performance

## 📋 **Local Testing Alternative**

If you want to test locally first:
```bash
cd agora-analyst-python
python test_github_actions_compliance.py
python validate_production.py
```

Both should pass with flying colors now!
