# Kritis V5.0 - Critical Fixes Applied

## Date: October 8, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. **Official Number Extraction**
**Problem**: Using source_id as fallback instead of extracting proper official numbers.

**Solution**:
- Added special case detection for Constitutional documents (CRP)
- Improved extraction logic with proper priority:
  1. **CRP Detection**: If title contains "ConstituiÃ§Ã£o da RepÃºblica Portuguesa" or "CRP", use "CRP"
  2. **Isolated Numbers**: Extract from last document chunk (e.g., "119617986")
  3. **Constructed Number**: Law type (PT) + "nÂº" + numbers from title
  4. **Metadata**: From extraction metadata
  5. **First Chunk**: Pattern matching in first chunk
  6. **Fallback**: Only use source_id as last resort

#### 2. **Enactment Date / valid_from NULL Issue**
**Problem**: `law_articles.valid_from` was NULL causing database constraint violations.

**Solution**:
- Added fallback to `sources.published_at` when metadata doesn't contain enactment_date
- Fetch actual enactment_date from created law record before processing articles
- Pass correct date to article creation

#### 3. **Translations Missing**
**Problem**: Article translations field was empty or not properly structured.

**Solution**:
- Fixed extraction path: `analysis.get('analysis', {})` correctly extracts PT/EN translations
- Added validation and fallback: Creates minimal translation structure if empty
- Added warning logging when translations are missing

#### 4. **Delete Function Name**
**Problem**: Using deprecated `delete_law_and_children` function.

**Solution**:
- Updated all calls to use `delete_law_by_law_id` as per updated SQL functions
- Updated in 3 locations: initial delete, retry delete, and recreate flow

### Files Modified:
- `agora-analyst-python/analysis/kritis_analyzer_v50.py`
- `context/agora-functions.sql` (documentation attachment)

### Test Results:
- âœ… Dependencies installed in virtual environment
- âœ… Environment validation passed
- âœ… Stage 1: Extraction works correctly (6 articles)
- âœ… Stage 2: Analysis in progress
- ðŸ”„ Stage 3: To be validated after full test completion

### Commits:
1. `f8bb242` - Fix: Handle dict vs string format for sources.translations.pt field
2. `4627509` - Critical fixes: Use sources.published_at fallback for enactment_date, fix delete_law_by_law_id function call, improve official_number extraction
3. `bce1ca5` - Fix: Retrieve enactment_date from created law record to ensure valid_from is populated
4. `602b11e` - Fix: Handle CRP (Constitutional) documents for official_number, ensure translations are properly extracted from analysis structure

### Next Steps:
- Run complete end-to-end test
- Validate law record creation with correct official_number ("CRP" for Constitutional docs)
- Validate all articles have proper translations
- Validate enactment_date is properly set from sources.published_at
